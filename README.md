##  Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salman254/Phase-4-project.git
cd startup-simulator 
```

### 1. Clone the Repository

Install Dependencies
###  pipenv install

Activate Shell
###  pipenv shell

Run the Flask Server
###  python run.py

By default it runs at http://localhost:5000/



###  Frontend setup

###  cd client

###  npm install

###  npm start

Opens at http://localhost:3000/


###  How It Works
Auth routes return JWTs stored in localStorage and sent via Authorization: Bearer <token>

Flask uses Blueprints to organize routes: auth/, startups/, investments/, users/

Frontend Dashboard.js dynamically loads all data on mount

React state is updated after every action to reflect DB changes immediately

 ###  Known Issues
Upload folder must exist (server/static/uploads/) or profile upload will fail

 Only image files are accepted in registration form
